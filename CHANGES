Additions
=========

*Added ability to update the robot software via ros command line interface
*Added joint trajectory interface
*Added joint velocity puppet example
*Added navigator interface (buttons, LEDs) and example.
*Exposed inverse kinematics solver
*Added camera interface, open/close/list all available cameras. Ability to adjust frame size, resolution, frames/second, gains, etc...
*Added cartesian endpoint state
*Added core manager allowing for listing, extraction and removal of saved core files

Removals
========

-Removed enable/disable service calls

Changes
=======

-Updated URDF
-Updated Baxter interface limb.py api changes. Generic naming 
-Changed mechanism for enabling robot
-Init.sh script now support all ros versions

Fixes
=====
-Fixed issue with exiting joystick examples
-Fixed wobbler periodically exits with 'failed to disable robot'
-Added numerous timeouts on state transitions (ie. robot enable, gripper calibration) and position movement validations (head position, limb joint positions).

Issues
======
                                          
-Calibration and Tare scripts will not run if there is a joint error at the head. 
Joint errors can be found in the robot monitor.

-The ROS_HOSTNAME is always set to "<robot_hostname>.local", 
which needs to be resolvable by a client machine (avahi, /etc/hosts or DNS server configuration)
