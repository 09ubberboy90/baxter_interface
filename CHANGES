Overview
========

The Research SDK provides a platform for roboticists to develop custom 
applications to run on the Baxter hardware platform.

It is designed for high level AI researchers, and those who work at the controls 
level, interested in kinematics, dynamics, force-based algorithms, and 
controlling redundant systems.

Issues
======
                                          
-Calibration and Tare scripts will not run if there is a joint error at the head. 
Joint errors can be found in the robot monitor.

-The ROS_HOSTNAME is always set to "<robot_hostname>.local", 
which needs to be resolvable by a client machine (avahi, /etc/hosts or DNS server configuration)
